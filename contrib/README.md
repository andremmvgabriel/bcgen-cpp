## VSCODE

This folder contains the needed jsons to work in vscode with the recommended extensions defined inside the `extensions.json` file.

To use these, you can either copy the vscode folder to the root of the project, or create a soft link to the same to the root of the project. Either way, in the root of the project, the folder has to be called .vscode.
